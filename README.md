# RevatureProject0

I made a simple message board app that is basically like one single thread in one single forum in regular forum software.
You might even think of it as a chat box. Users can create an account and then send messages in the simple form
on the root route. They can manage their account and also view previous messages in the order that they
were made.

# Users can join the service on a website

Forms and routings have been provided to let users create accounts.

# Users can create multiple accounts

There is no limit to accounts

# Users can input a request to your service

My service supports get and post requests

# Users can view their previous requests

Previous requests are mainly viewable in the form of messages on the message board

# Users can close their accounts

Users can choose to deactivate their account
